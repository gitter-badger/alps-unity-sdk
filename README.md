`AlpsSDK` is a contextualized publish/subscribe model which can be used to model any geolocated or proximity based mobile application. Save time and make development easier by using our SDK. We are built on Android Location services and we also provide iBeacons compatibility.

## Unity compatibility

SDK is written for Unity 2017 and support Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.

## Technical overview

The `Matchmore` is a static wrapper that provides you all the functions you need to use our SDK.

## Usage

```
        //get the api key from our portal
        var config = Matchmore.Config.WithApiKey(apiKey);
        Matchmore.Configure(config);
	    // we register the device as the main device
        var mainDevice = Matchmore.Instance.MainDevice;

        //methods interacting with devices by default use the main device, but there are overloads to provide other devices
        var pub = Matchmore.Instance.CreatePublication(new Publication
        {
            Topic = "Unity",
            Duration = 30,
            Range = 100,
            Properties = new Dictionary<string, object>(){
                {"test", true},
                {"price", 199}
            }
        });

        var sub = Matchmore.Instance.CreateSubscription(new Subscription
        {
            Topic = "Unity",
            Duration = 30,
            Range = 100,
            Selector = "test = true and price <= 200",
            Pushers = new List<string>() { "ws" }
        });

        foreach (var _pub in Matchmore.Instance.ActivePublications)
        {
            LogLine(string.Format("Pub {0} existings for another {1} seconds", _pub.Id, _pub.SecondsRemaining()));
        }

        foreach (var _sub in Matchmore.Instance.ActiveSubscriptions)
        {
            LogLine(string.Format("Sub {0} existing for another {1} seconds", _sub.Id, _sub.SecondsRemaining()));
        }

        //this method is available but we run a coroutine in the background which starts the unity location service and runs this call every time the location was changed
        Matchmore.Instance.UpdateLocation(new Location
        {
            Latitude = 54.414662,
            Longitude = 18.625498
        });

        //query for available matches via a single request
        var matches = Matchmore.Instance.GetMatches();
        matches.ForEach(m =>
        {
            LogLine("Got Match " + m.Id + " single call");
        });

        //creates a monitor on a single device which has an event handler(by default the main one)
        var socketMonitor = Matchmore.Instance.SubscribeMatches(Matchmore.MatchChannel.Websocket);

        //creates a monitor on a single device which has an event handler(by default the main one)
        var pollingMonitor = Matchmore.Instance.SubscribeMatches(Matchmore.MatchChannel.Polling);

        //this event handler fires only for a single device
        socketMonitor.MatchReceived += (sender, e) => {
            LogLine(string.Format("Received match {0} from device {1} with channel {2} directly from monitor", e.Matches[0].Id, e.Device.Id, e.Channel));
        };

        pollingMonitor.MatchReceived += (sender, e) => {
            LogLine(string.Format("Received match {0} from device {1} with channel {2} directly from monitor", e.Matches[0].Id, e.Device.Id, e.Channel));
        };

        //this event handler fires for all devices created
        Matchmore.Instance.MatchReceived += (sender, e) => {
            LogLine(string.Format("Received match {0} from device {1} with channel {2}", e.Matches[0].Id, e.Device.Id, e.Channel));
        };

```
